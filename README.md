## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This is a data science project to find the best neighborhood to live in a faraway city. This project deals with unlabeled data, due to that reason I used an unsupervised algorithm, namely the K-mean algorithm. This project is an excellent example of how effective the K-mean algorithm clustering unlabeled data.

# What is the problem?

I work in downtown Memphis, TN. In general, I live 30 mins away from
work, when there is no traffic. However, since I am commuting when most
of the people are commuting to there work, there is almost always
traffic on the roads. So it is easily 45-60 mins one-way trip. Being
optimistic, considering one-way is 45 mins, it is 90 mins for a round
trip. For a week with 5 workdays, it is 7.5 hours, for a month it is 30
hours, for a year it is 16 days. So for a given year, I am wasting full
16 days counting days and nights riding my car wasting my time.

I am planning to move St.~Louis, Missouri for a new job offer. While I
have a friend already living there, I would like to do my analysis and
find out where I can move. But driving time is something I strongly want
to reduce.

** So the problem is, where I should move to save some time from
driving but still have good amenities such as restaurants, cafes, parks,
shopping, etc within reachable distance. **

Also, one of the jobs I was being interviewed is in St.~Louis, Illinois.
I want to do a similar analyze there to find out if I can find a good
neighborhood to live.
