        "#### &emsp; 1.1 What is the problem?\n",
        "I work in downtown Memphis, TN. In general, I live 30 mins away from work, when there is no traffic. However, since I am commuting when most of the people are commuting to there work, there is almost always traffic on the roads. So it is easily 45-60 mins one-way trip. Being optimistic, considering one-way is 45 mins, it is 90 mins for a round trip. For a week with 5 workdays,  it is 7.5 hours, for a month it is 30 hours, for a year it is 16 days. So for a given year, I am wasting full 16 days counting days and nights riding my car wasting my time. \n",
        "\n",
        "**So the problem is, where I should move to save some time from driving but still have good amenities such as restaurants, cafes, parks, shopping, etc within reachable distance.** \n",
        "\n",
        "Also, one of the jobs I was being interviewed is in St. Louis, Illinois. I want to do a similar analyze there to find out if I can find a good neigbhorhood to live.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### &emsp; 1.2 Where is this?\n",
        "It is Memphis, Tennesse, where birds sing and elephants bath, just kidding. But it is definitely is a fantastic place to live. There are tons of things to do around here. The population was roughly 700 k and rising. The job market is good. Most people are friendly. You should have some BBQs around the town, you won't leave Memphis.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### &emsp; 1.3 When is this applicable?\n",
        "I know this is a changing world! The time will change everything. The time of this analysis is August 2019. So don't blame me if you decided to move based on this data analysis in 2050. But the good thing is, I developed the program to pull the latest data. So if you re-run the program in 2050, you should be (may be...) fine? \n",
        "\n",
        "#### &emsp; 1.4 Why do we do this?\n",
        "It is to primarily to save time. I am spending so much time on the road, 16 full days per year! just to commute.  People say time is money. So it is to save me some money. I am sure if you are in the same boat, following this, you might able to save some money with this. Who doesn't like saving money for next cruise trip? Waight, is someone paying me when I save my own time? Ney.. I will use this saved time to play with my daughters. Not everything is money. I think I have bipolar disorder.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### &emsp; 1.5 Who cares?\n",
        "Do you even here me? It is to save money (really the time). If you are someone who cares about saving money (time), you should read. If you have plenty of those lying around that you don't know what to do, this is not for you. You should spend some money buying a boat and traveling the world instead of reading this. \n"
